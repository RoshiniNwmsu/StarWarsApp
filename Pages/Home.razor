<h1>Welcome to StarWarsApp</h1>

<p>
    This app is built with <strong>Blazor WebAssembly</strong> and showcases Star Wars data from the public API in a clean, searchable, and organized format.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Character Search:</strong> On the <em>Characters</em> page, you can search characters by name. Only valid character names are shown — entries with numbers or missing names are filtered out for better clarity.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Vehicles by Manufacturer:</strong> On the <em>Vehicles</em> page, vehicles are grouped by their manufacturer. You can view the name, model, and cost (in credits) of each vehicle in a clean layout.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Films:</strong> The <em>Films</em> page lists all the main Star Wars saga films. You can later extend this to show which characters and vehicles appear in each film.
</p>

<p>
    This is a fully client-side Single Page Application (SPA) with fast navigation and smooth user experience.
